#### üêõ Bug Fixes
*   **File Permissions:** Fixed a `PermissionError` that occurred when launching the application from "Recent Apps" by ensuring all file paths are absolute.
*   **Window Position:** Corrected the initial window position to prevent the application from opening partially off-screen.
*   **Fullscreen Display:** Resolved an issue where white bars would appear when the application was in fullscreen mode.
*   **Application Stability:** Fixed a bug that caused the application to hang after long periods of inactivity by implementing a more robust event system for thread communication.
